For the given dataset, perform clustering using KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN. 
Compare the results using evaluation metrics (e.g., Silhouette Score, ARI) and visualizations. 
Interpret the clusters in terms of the dataset context (e.g., customer segments, patient groups, wine types). 
Finally, discuss which clustering algorithm is most suitable for the dataset and why.
